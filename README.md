What is this?
-------------

I will use this GitHub repository to share small scripts of the kind you made for personal purposes,
and probably you only use them once. But just in case somebody needs something similar of the simple
code contained in it could be of any help.

What do we have so far?
-----------------------

  - 'video/' some scripts to do tasks related to video
  - 'last.fm/' just some simple Python scripts that perform queries to the last.fm API
  - 'tumblr-importr/' again, Python scripts to insert posts into Tumblr (I used them when I migrated my blog that was stored somewhere else into Tumblr).
